## AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

About This Project:

This project focuses on creating an AI-powered chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK and scikit-learn. The chatbot is designed to understand user inputs and provide relevant responses using a predefined corpus and TF-IDF vectorization.

Key Features:

1) Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for intelligent responses.
2) Processes user input and finds the best-matching response from the corpus.
3) Stores chat history for short-term memory.
4) Handles small talk, greetings, and basic FAQs.
5) Simple and efficient implementation using Python.

How It Works:

1) **Load Corpus** – The chatbot uses a predefined set of questions and responses stored in `corpus.txt`.
2) **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenizes and vectorizes input using TF-IDF.
3) **Similarity Calculation** – Compares user input with stored corpus questions using cosine similarity.
4) **Response Generation** – Provides the most relevant answer based on similarity score.
5) **Chat History** – Maintains a small conversation history for context retention.

Technologies Used:

1) Python
2) NLTK (for NLP tasks)
3) scikit-learn (for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity matching)

Installation and Usage:

1) Ensure corpus.txt is present in the project folder.
2) Install required libraries:
   pip install nltk scikit-learn
3) Run the chatbot script:
   python chatbot.py

Project Files:

1) chatbot.py – Main chatbot script.
2) corpus.txt – Contains predefined questions and responses.
3) requirements.txt – Lists all dependencies.

Challenges Faced and Learnings:

1) Implementing meaningful responses with limited corpus data.
2) Optimizing similarity threshold for better accuracy.
3) Maintaining conversation flow using chat history.
4) Enhancing chatbot intelligence within a lightweight implementation.

Conclusion:

This project provided hands-on experience in NLP, text vectorization, and chatbot development. Using Python, NLTK, and scikit-learn, we successfully built a basic chatbot capable of answering simple questions based on predefined data.
